# **App Name**: Hogwarts House

## Core Features:

- Interactive House Quiz: Presents a sequence of multiple-choice questions, each subtly aligned with one of the four Hogwarts houses. User selections influence the final sorting decision based on underlying house scores.
- House Result Display: After quiz completion, the user is sorted into one of the four houses—Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin. The result is presented with house crests, animations, and signature sounds for an immersive reveal.
- House Information Details: Post-result, the app displays a beautifully styled card with unique qualities of the assigned house, including values, notable alumni, and emblematic symbols.
- AI-Driven Facts Generation: A built-in AI companion tool offers magical facts, fun trivia, and lore based on the user’s house. It keeps the content fresh, entertaining, and aligned with the theme of Hogwarts magic.
- Quiz Progress Tracker: A magical-themed progress bar styled like a Marauder’s Map or enchanted parchment shows how far the user has gone in the quiz, enhancing interactivity and visual feedback.
- Result History & Retake Option: Logged-in users can view their past sorting results stored in the database and have the option to retake the quiz. Result trends per user are shown with house icons and dates.
- Dynamic Shareable Result Cards: Upon receiving a house, users can download or share a stylized magical result card image containing their name, house emblem, and quote. This card is designed to match their house colors and crest.
- Global House Leaderboard: A real-time global counter shows how many users have been sorted into each house. Each house bar updates live with animations and glows in the house’s color as users are sorted.
- Admin Spellbook Panel: An admin-only portal for updating quiz questions, monitoring sorting stats, moderating facts, and pushing magical announcements (e.g., “House Cup updates”).
